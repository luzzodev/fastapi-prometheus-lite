# FastAPI Prometheus Lite

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-personal-blueviolet)

A fast, minimal Prometheus middleware for FastAPI ‚Äî no multiprocessing, no env config, no body reads. Just clean, efficient metrics.

---

## üìñ Description

**FastAPI Prometheus Lite** is a lightweight and high-performance Prometheus middleware for FastAPI applications. It provides essential request-level metrics such as request counts and durations, while avoiding the overhead of more feature-rich instrumentors. This library is ideal for developers who want **precise, clean metrics** without pulling in unnecessary complexity.

### ‚ú® Why Lite?

This project was created with a clear goal in mind: provide **just enough instrumentation** for FastAPI performance and visibility ‚Äî and nothing more.

Compared to full-fledged solutions, this package intentionally avoids:
- ‚ùå Multiprocessing support (unnecessary for most simple deployments)
- ‚ùå Environment-based configuration (explicit is better than implicit)
- ‚ùå Automatic registration of default or system-level metrics
- ‚ùå Request and response body parsing (to keep things fast and safe)

Instead, it focuses on:
- ‚úÖ Precise, labeled Prometheus metrics (`http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`)
- ‚úÖ Zero-config setup with FastAPI‚Äôs native middleware interface
- ‚úÖ Minimal dependency tree (just `fastapi` and `prometheus-client`)
- ‚úÖ ASGI-native implementation with optional Starlette type support

It‚Äôs perfect for lean microservices, observability-conscious APIs, and production-like setups where **performance and control matter**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project was developed for **personal use and as a showcase of FastAPI middleware design**. It is not intended to be a production-ready replacement for full-featured solutions. Feel free to use it as inspiration, reference, or a learning tool ‚Äî not as a drop-in replacement unless you've reviewed and tailored it to your own needs.

## Credits

This project is heavily inspired by [prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator](https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator) by [@trallnag](https://github.com/trallnag).

It borrows the overall design philosophy of exposing route-aware, labeled Prometheus metrics for FastAPI applications. However, the codebase here is a ground-up reimplementation focused on simplicity, performance, and explicit configuration.
